# Home_Automation_Project #
Home automation project for VMKS/MPS

For now, we need extra parts for the project to actually take place

Those parts are:

* 2 Motion sensors;
* Photoresistor *** the ones for Raspberry Pi are somehow different from the normal ones ***;
* Thermodiode
* A few relays
* 2 rejka (whatever it means)
* ~~1 Buzzer~~
